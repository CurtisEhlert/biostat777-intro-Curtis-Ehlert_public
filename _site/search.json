    "text": "Curtis was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, and attended McGill University in Montreal, earning a Bachelor of Engineering in bioengineering in 2024. While there, he studied trypanosome protein structure-function at the McGill Institute of Parasitology and worked as a tissue engineering and pharmaceutical biologics researcher. Curious about astromycology and its applications, Curtis joined the lab in 2025 and is currently studying the effects of microgravity on C. neoformans physiology. In addition to his research, Curtis is interested in the applications of metaphysics and epistemology to scientific practice, in music composition, and in non-profit work in advancing biomedical engineering education and opportunities."

    "text": "Introduction\nUsing our data, we will examine how music output from the Beatles varied over their seven-year long career. We will ask what how many albums per year were put out, how many songs were included in each album, and will find the average duration of their songs over each year they were released. In doing so, we may evaluate their diligence by assessing music output over time.\nThis data analysis is meant for Beatles enthusiasts, lay Beatles fans, or just those who are Beatles-curious.\nData originated from ’The Beatles Spotify Song Data’, Uploaded by Chad Wambles on Kaggle.\n\nOriginal data set source (Wambles 2024): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadwambles/allbeatlesspotifysongdata2009remaster/data\nMetadata file attached here: Download data_dictionary"

    "text": "Summary\nThe Beatles, despite all of their accolades, were only a commercial band for seven years, between 1963 and 1970 (Barlow 2025). By tracking simple statistics around song and album release details and song duration, we begin to paint a picture of a dynamic, persistent group, never faltering in their output. We can observe from figure 1 that average song duration nearly doubles in 1967 from 1966, and falls steadily thereafter. Figure 2 shows their consistent output, continuously releasing 1-2 albums every year. While figure 3 shows number of songs released per album was steady, we see a massive spike for the White Album, with the year it was released (1967) also featuring the longest duration songs on average (Barry 2018)."
