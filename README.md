Designed for Project 1

The author of this website is Curtis Ehlert. I used RStudio to write my .qmd files, and used Kaggle, an online site featuring thousands of publicly available datasets. As a Beatles fan and musician, I wanted to use this opportunity to design basic plots exploring the Beatles' music output over their short (7 year long) career.
