Curtis was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, and attended McGill University in Montreal, earning a Bachelor of Engineering in bioengineering in 2024. While there, he studied trypanosome protein structure-function at the McGill Institute of Parasitology and worked as a tissue engineering and pharmaceutical biologics researcher. Curious about astromycology and its applications, Curtis joined the lab in 2025 and is currently studying the effects of microgravity on *C. neoformans* physiology. In addition to his research, Curtis is interested in the applications of metaphysics and epistemology to scientific practice, in music composition, and in non-profit work in advancing biomedical engineering education and opportunities.
